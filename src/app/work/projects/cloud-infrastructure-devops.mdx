## Overview

Built a production-style cloud platform for file management with secure networking, infrastructure automation, and zero-downtime delivery workflows.

## Architecture

- Developed a REST API in **Node.js** running on **EC2**.
- Used **RDS** for relational storage and **S3** for object storage.
- Provisioned infrastructure with **Terraform**, including VPC networking, load balancing, and Route 53 DNS.

## Security

- Applied least-privilege IAM policies.
- Enforced encryption at rest and in transit.
- Restricted access via VPC security groups and HTTPS-only traffic with SSL/TLS certificates.

## Delivery & Observability

- Automated CI/CD using **GitHub Actions** and **Packer** for AMI creation.
- Enabled gated promotions and rolling deployments for zero-downtime releases.
- Configured CloudWatch agents, StatsD metrics, dashboards, health checks, and alarm-driven recovery.
- Delivered **99.9% uptime** through proactive monitoring and autoscaling controls.
