## Overview

This project implements a distributed task execution platform for asynchronous job processing, real-time progress updates, and durable result storage.

## System Design

- Built core services in **Go** with a **React** frontend.
- Used **Kafka** for event streaming, **Redis** for status caching, and **RabbitMQ** for request-reply patterns.
- Connected workers over **gRPC** and streamed live status with **GraphQL + WebSocket** subscriptions.

## Reliability & Performance

- Implemented idempotent job delivery and robust retry/backoff handling.
- Achieved **2500 jobs/minute** peak throughput.
- Kept status lookup latency below **40ms p95** in AKS deployment tests.
- Added graceful shutdown, reconnect handling, and observability fields (`job_id`, `trace_id`) across flows.

## Deployment

- Added Kubernetes deployment scaffolding.
- Validated horizontal scaling to 8 workers in single-host Docker-based test environments.
