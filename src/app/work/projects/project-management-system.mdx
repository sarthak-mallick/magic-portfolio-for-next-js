## Overview

Built a JIRA-inspired project management application as part of Enterprise Software Design (Fall 2024), focused on robust backend design, secure workflows, and responsive user interactions.

## Architecture

- Developed a full-stack system using **Java Spring Boot MVC** with **JSP** frontend rendering.
- Integrated **Hibernate ORM** for data persistence with a **MySQL** backend.
- Deployed on **Apache Tomcat** and used **AJAX** for real-time UI updates.

## Security & Reliability

- Implemented basic authentication and interceptor-based access control for protected routes.
- Added server-side input validation and SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries.
- Applied the **Post-Redirect-Get** pattern to prevent duplicate writes from form resubmissions.
